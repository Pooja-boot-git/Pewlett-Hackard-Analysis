# PEWLETT-HACKARD-ANALYSIS

## PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS
The goal of this analysis is to provide seemless transition to Pewlett-Hackard employees for a scenario where a rather large strength of employees will retire around the same time. 

## WHAT DEFINES RETIREMENT AGE?
For this challenge, we have considered all employees whose birth dates fall betweeen '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31'. 
1. We have 90,398 employees who will retire within the span of 3 years.
2. Below table shows the count of retiring employees grouped by their job titles.

3. Count of employees grouped by job titles who are eligible for the mentorship program. These employees have to undergo trainings to fill up the vacant slots that will be created when eligible employees retire from the organization.

## WHAT DID WE LEARN?
1. There are 1,940 people who can fill up the empty slots in future. There is a deficit of 88,458 positions. This is a huge gap which is nearly impossible to fill.
3. Approximately 64% of retiring staff belong to Senior Engineer and Senior Staff group which will lead to big dent in the experienced skill set of the company.

## WHAT'S THE PLAN?
1. The number of people retiring is exceptionally high. The company needs to revisit it's retirement criteria so that we don't end up losing a major population of employees.
2. Once it revisits its retirement criteria, Pewlett-Hackard may have to look into big scale hiring as well.
